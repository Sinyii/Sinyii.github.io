### [Try the dining chatbot](https://dining-chat-bot2.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=code&client_id=7a56fi10nj9q599klq7tjog785&redirect_uri=https://dkqtjjobwip8d.cloudfront.net/dining_chat.html) 
+ This domain is provided by **AWS cognito** and the redirect url is provided by **AWS cloudFront**.
+ You can use [10 minutes email](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) to sign up or just use the sample account below.
+ **Sample account**:
    - user name: sinyi
    - pwd: 12345678
+ Check the code on my [github](https://github.com/Sinyii/AWS-dining-chatbot-w-yelp-api).

+ Further explainations:
    - Using AWS cloudFront is for preventing people to connect with my S3 bucket directly, otherwise they could touch my other stuff in this bucket.

### 1. First, login to through cognito to get permission of connecting with chatbot.
