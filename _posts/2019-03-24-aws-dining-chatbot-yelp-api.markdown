### =>[Try the dining chatbot](https://dining-chat-bot2.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=code&client_id=7a56fi10nj9q599klq7tjog785&redirect_uri=https://dkqtjjobwip8d.cloudfront.net/dining_chat.html) 

#### About the link:
+ There are **two urls** in the above link :
    - https://dining-chat-bot2.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
    - https://dkqtjjobwip8d.cloudfront.net/dining_chat.html
+ The first url is provided by **AWS cognito** for giving user autherization and the second url will redirect qualified user to the chatbot page. 
+ The redirect url **had been** the actual path of dining_chat.html in my S3 bucket, but I used **AWS cloudFront** to transform it into a safer format for preventing people to connect with my S3 bucket directly.

#### How to use:
+ You can use [10 minutes email](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) to sign up or just use the sample account below.
+ Sample account:
    - **user name**: sinyi
    - **pwd**: 12345678
    


### 1. First, login through the AWS cognito page to get permission of connecting with chatbot.
